# ECE496 - Capstone

## Repo Organization
Each aspect of the project (hardware, cloud backend, web frontend portal) are contained in their own separate folder. These folders should be as independent as possible to improve team throughput. Tests, scripts and diagrams should be filed appropriately under these folders, or provide a link to their location on the [Shared Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B8dPLKh0gm9VLUIwZkdEZlFNVzA?usp=sharing)
